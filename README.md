Tic Tac Toe with AI

A classic game of Tic Tac Toe implemented in Python, with an AI player using the Minimax algorithm.

Features

- Play against a computer opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
- Choose the difficulty level of the AI player (easy, medium, hard).
- Interactive text-based interface for playing the game.
- Valid input checks to ensure proper gameplay.
- Option to play against another human player.

Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/).

Usage

- Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git.
- Navigate to the project directory Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI-Python/Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (Python)/task/tictactoe.py
- Launch the game by running python tictactoe.py in the terminal.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to select the game mode (start user (easy/medium/hard)) and the difficulty level of the AI player (easy, medium, hard).
- Make your moves by inputting the row and column numbers for your desired move.
- The game will continue until there is a winner or a draw, and the winner or the result will be displayed.

Implementation

The game is implemented using Python and follows the standard rules of Tic Tac Toe. The AI player uses the Minimax algorithm, which recursively evaluates all possible moves and chooses the best move based on the current game state.

The game logic is organized into separate modules for the game board, the AI player, and the main game loop. The board.py module provides functions to display the game board, check for winning conditions, and validate player moves. The AI player is using the Minimax algorithm. The tic_tac_toe.py module contains the main game loop and user input handling.

Customization
You can customize the game. You can update the game board size, change the difficulty levels of the AI player, or modify the game loop to add new features or game modes.
