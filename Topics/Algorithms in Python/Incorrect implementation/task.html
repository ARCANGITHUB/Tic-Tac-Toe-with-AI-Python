<h2>Incorrect implementation</h2>
<p>In programming, it is important to understand and analyze algorithms written by other people. Given below is an algorithm that counts even numbers in a list of integers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def count_even(numbers):
    counter = 0

    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] % 4 == 0:
            counter += 1

    return counter</code></pre>
<p>This implementation contains some mistakes. Select all lists for which this implementation produces an incorrect result.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Take a look at the condition that we check in the algorithm. What cases does this implementation miss?</p>
