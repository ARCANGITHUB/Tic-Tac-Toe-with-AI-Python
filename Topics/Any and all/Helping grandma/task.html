<h2>Helping grandma</h2>
<p>Your grandma really likes gardening. Her plants and flowers are known in the whole neighborhood, and she is really proud of them. This month has been unusually chilly, and she needs to know when to take some of her pots inside. She's asked you to look at the weather<br>
forecast for the next week and tell her if any of the nights the temperature will drop below 0Â°C to prepare for the relocation of the plants.</p>

<p>Now, of course, you don't need to write a program to look at the weekly weather forecast, but it is a good chance to practice <code class="java">any</code> and <code class="java">all</code>! Look at the lowest night temperatures for the following week:</p>

<p><code class="java">lowest_temperatures = [+2, +4, -1, +0.5, -2, 0, -1]</code></p>

<p>Positive temperatures are given with the plus sign, but it's merely for convenience. Choose what <code class="java">any(lowest_temperatures)</code> and <code class="java">all(lowest_temperatures)</code> functions will return in this case.</p>
