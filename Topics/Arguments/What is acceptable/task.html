<h2>What is acceptable</h2>
<p>Imagine you have a friend named Tom. He has recently started learning arguments in Python. His school teacher gave him a task on choosing <strong>wrong ways of calling a function</strong>. Help Tom complete the task. Select all the ways of calling a function that <strong>do<em> NOT</em> apply for this one</strong>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b</code></pre>

<p>Mind that keyword arguments should follow the non-keyword. Also, an argument cannot be initialized twice.</p>
