<h2>The number of students</h2>
<p>We wrote a simple program that deals with the total number of students in the class and does calculations with it. This number is stored in the variable <code class="language-python">n</code>. In the code, it is declared as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">n = 10  # stores the number of students in the class</code></pre>

<p>What would be a better way of declaring this variable? And do we need the comment in this case? Choose the best option. </p>
