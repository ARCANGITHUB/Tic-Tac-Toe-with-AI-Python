<h2>Paintings</h2>
<p>Suppose we have a class that stores the names of the paintings and their artists. We want to create a special attribute for one of its instances, <code class="language-python">impression_sunrise</code>, that stores the year of creation:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">impression_sunrise.year_of_creation = 1872</code></pre>

<p>What will happen if we try to access this attribute from any other instance of the class?</p>
