<h2>New groups</h2>
<p></p>
<p>A kindergarten in Berlin may open a certain amount of new groups. Their names are in the list <code class="java">groups = ['1A', '1B', '1C', '2A', '2B', '2C', '3A', '3B', '3C']</code>. Children are divided into groups starting from <code class="java">1A</code> and ending with <code class="java">3C</code>. However, if there are not so many kids, only the first groups in the list will be filled up.</p>
<p>Create and print a dictionary, where group names will be written as keys, and the number of kids in the group as values. The number of groups and children in each group you will get as input:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first line is a number of groups to be filled.</li>
<li>Subsequent lines are the number of children in each group, listed in the same order as the groups list variable.</li>
<li>If there are less than 9 groups to be filled, any unfilled groups should have a value of <code class="java">None</code>.</li>
