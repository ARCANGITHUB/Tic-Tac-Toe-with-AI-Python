<h2>Nested</h2>
<p>Imagine there are three children in a family and they all wrote down what they want to be when they grow up:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">children = {'Emily': 'artist', 'Adam': 'astronaut', 'Nancy': 'programmer'}</code></pre>

<p>Let's say you want to store not only the profession they have chosen but also their age: Emily is 5, Adam is 9, and Nancy is 14. To do so, you can create nested dictionaries for each key in the outer dictionary.</p>

<p>For each name, create a nested dictionary with the keys <code class="language-python">'profession'</code> and <code class="language-python">'age'</code>, modify the dictionary <code class="language-python">children</code>, but don't print it.</p>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> write the age as an integer.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
