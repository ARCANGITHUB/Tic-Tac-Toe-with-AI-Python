<h2>For loop</h2>
<html><body><p>Computers are known for their ability to do things that people consider to be boring and energy-consuming. For example, repeating identical tasks without any errors is one of these things. In this topic, we'll learn what Python tool can help you with that, how to implement it, and what functions you can use along with it.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-iteration" style="text-align: center;">What is iteration?</h5>
<p>In Python, the process of repetitive execution of the same block of code is called an <strong>iteration</strong>.</p>
<p>There are two types of iteration:</p>
<p><strong>Definite iteration</strong>, where the number of repetitions is stated in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Indefinite iteration</strong>, where a code block executes as long as the condition stated in advance is true.</p>
<p>After the first iteration, the program comes back to the beginning of the code's body and repeats it, making a so-called <strong>loop</strong>. The most popular is the <code class="language-python">for</code><strong> </strong>loop<strong>, </strong>named after the <code class="language-python">for</code><strong> operator</strong>, which provides the code's execution. <code class="language-python">For</code> loops are usually considered to be definite. </p>
<h5 id="for-loop-syntax" style="text-align: center;">For loop syntax</h5>
<p>Here is the scheme of the loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for variable in iterable:
    statement</code></pre>
<p>where <code class="language-python">statement</code> is a block of operations executed for each item in<strong> </strong><code class="language-python">iterable</code><strong>, </strong>an object used in iteration (e.g., a string or a list). <code class="language-python">Variable</code> takes the value of the next item from the iterable after each iteration.</p>
<p>Now try to guess what output we'll get if we execute the following piece of code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">oceans = ['Atlantic', 'Pacific', 'Indian', 'Southern', 'Arctic']
for ocean in oceans:
    print(ocean)</code></pre>
<p>During each iteration, the program will take one item from the list and execute the statements on it, so the final output will be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">Atlantic
Pacific
Indian
Southern
Arctic</code></pre>
<p>Strings are also iterable, so you can spell a word, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for char in 'magic':
    print(char)</code></pre>
<p> Like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">m
a
g
i
c</code></pre>
<h5 id="range-function" style="text-align: center;">Range function</h5>
<p>The <code class="language-python">range()</code><strong> </strong>function can be used to specify the number of iterations. It returns a sequence of numbers from 0 (by default) and ends at a specified number. Be careful: the last number won't be in the output since we started from 0.</p>
<p>Let's look at the example below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for i in range(5):
    print(i)</code></pre>
<p>What we'll get is this: </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">0
1
2
3
4</code></pre>
<p>You can change the <strong>starting value</strong> if you're not satisfied with 0, moreover, you can configure the <strong>increment (step)</strong> value by adding a third parameter:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for i in range(5, 45, 10):
    print(i)</code></pre>
<p>According to the parameters included, we've asked to print the numbers from 5 to 45 with an increment value of 10. Be careful again, the last value is not included in the output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">5
15
25
35</code></pre>
<p>If you're not going to use the counter variable in your loop, you can show it by replacing its name with the underscore symbol:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for _ in range(100):
    do_smth()</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, we don't need the counter variable in any way, we simply use the loop to repeat the <code class="language-python">do_smth()</code> function a given number of times. </p>
<h5 id="input-data-processing" style="text-align: center;">Input data processing </h5>
<p>You can also use the <code class="language-python">input()</code><strong> function </strong>that helps the user to pass a value to some variable and work with it. Thus, you can get the same output as with the previous piece of code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">word = input()
for char in word:
    print(char)</code></pre>
<p>Oh, look, you can write a piece of code with a practical purpose:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">times = int(input('How many times should I say "Hello"?'))
for i in range(times):
    print('Hello!')</code></pre>
<p>You can, therefore, ask the user to specify the number of iterations to be performed.</p>
<h5 id="nested-loop" style="text-align: center;">Nested loop</h5>
<p>In Python, it is easy to put one loop inside another one â€“ a <strong>nested loop</strong>. The type of the inner and outer loops doesn't matter, the first to execute is the outer loop, then the inner one executes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">names = ['Rose', 'Daniel']
surnames = ['Miller', 'Smith']
for name in names:
    for surname in surnames:
         print(name, surname)</code></pre>
<p>The output is shown below: </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">Rose Miller
Rose Smith
Daniel Miller
Daniel Smith</code></pre>

Click <code class="language-python">Next&gt;</code> and follow the arrows. In this example,  we use two <code class="language-python">for</code> loops to create fictional people's names. You can deal with iterable objects of different sizes without too much fuss.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p>All in all, <code class="language-python">for</code> loops are an efficient way to automate some repetitive actions. You can add variables and operations to make a nested loop. Moreover, you can control the number of iterations with the help of the <code class="language-python">range()</code> function. Be careful with the syntax: an extra indent or the lack of a colon can cause a mistake!</p></body></html>
