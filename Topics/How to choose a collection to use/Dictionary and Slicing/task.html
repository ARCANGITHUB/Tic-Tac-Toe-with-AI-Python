<h2>Dictionary and Slicing</h2>
<html><body><p>Assume you have a dictionary of children's names and toys that belong to them. </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">names_toys = {"Tom": "car", "Suzy": "teddy bear", "Sam": "boat", "Lucy": "ball"}</code></pre>
<p>You want to know the first two entries of this dictionary (<code class="language-python">{"Tom": "car", "Suzy": "teddy bear"}</code>). To do so, you must slice the dictionary. Is this correct?</p></body></html>
