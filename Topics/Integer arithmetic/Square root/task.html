<h2>Square root</h2>
<p><strong></strong></p><div class="alert alert-primary"><strong>Wow! This problem is kind of tricky. If you're ready to put your thinking cap on, brace yourself and good luck! Otherwise, you can skip it for now and return any time later.</strong></div><p></p>
<p>Extracting the square root of a number is equivalent to raising this number to a certain power. What power are we talking about?</p>
<p>To illustrate it with an example: if <span class="math-tex">\(\sqrt{25} = 5\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(25^x = 5\)</span>, what is the value of <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>?</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> It's a floating-point number!</p>
