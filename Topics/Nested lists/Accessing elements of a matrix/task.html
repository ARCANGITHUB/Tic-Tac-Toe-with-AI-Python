<h2>Accessing elements of a matrix</h2>
<p>Let's say we have a matrix M:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">M = [[34, 77, 8,  45],
     [10, 15, 93, 57],
     [78, 82, 19, 98]]</code></pre>

<p>Write a code that will print the element in the first column and the third row. Mind that the size and the number of elements in the test matrix will be the same, but the integers in it will be different.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
