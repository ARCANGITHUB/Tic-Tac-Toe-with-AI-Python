<p>When dealing with <code class="language-python">dict.keys()</code>, you can use some operations for combining them. For instance, <code class="language-python">&amp;</code> will denote the intersection of dictionary keys even if their values are different. Have a look at the code below. What is the right output?</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">tim_toys = {'teddy bear': 3, 'toy car': 5, 'lion': 7, 'puppy': 5}
tom_toys = {'doll': 3, 'puppy': 2, 'kitten': 4, 'teddy bear': 3}
print(tim_toys.keys() &amp; tom_toys.keys())</code></pre>
